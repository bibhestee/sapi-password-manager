 ## API Documentation
 
  ### Overview

  This is a JSON based API with total of 12 endpoints

  To start making requests you should configure a BASE URL which will be used on all the API endpoints. For this project the base url is:

  Base URL
  `https://localhost:3002/api/v1`

  ### Authentication

  Great news! This API uses authentication and does so in a standardized way. This means you shouldn't have problems with adding authentication to your requests and your client library will probably support it out of the box.

  To authenticate the requests you should setup the following:

  | Type | Value | Location |
  | --- |--- | --- |
  | Bearer | Token | headers |
